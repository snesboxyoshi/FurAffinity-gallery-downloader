# FurAffinity-gallery-downloader
A small script to download everything off any user gallery from FurAffinity (including deleted art and galleries from deleted accounts) off that one onion site that archives everything ever posted on FA, now made 100% more idiot proof so long as you know how to use the terminal and give the file permissions to the current active user or all users (sudo chmod 777 FAG-D.sh).

Once that's done, just run it through the terminal and it'll do the rest. 

This only works on Arch Linux, Manjaro, and any other Arch-based Linux distro out there (excluding Artix Linux as it doesn't use SystemD)
