# FurAffinity-gallery-downloader
A small script to download everything off any user gallery from FurAffinity (including deleted art and galleries from deleted accounts) off that one onion site that archives everything ever posted on FA, now made 100% more idiot proof so long as you know how to use the terminal and give the file permissions to the current active user or all users (sudo chmod 777 FAGD-(insert version here).sh).

Once that's done, just run it through the terminal and it'll do the rest. 

FAGD-ARCH.sh should work on Arch Linux, Manjaro, Steam OS, and any other Arch-based Linux distro out there (excluding Artix Linux as it doesn't use SystemD) while FAGD-DEBIAN.sh should work on debian-based distros like Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Pop!_OS, ext. I haven't tested the debian out yet as I don't use Debian, but if anyone cares to try it out, let me know if it works as intended.

If you don't use any of those, yet know how to install packages in your respective distro as well as starting up services on whatever thing your distro uses for services, then use the manual version.
