# FurAffinity-gallery-downloader
A small script to download everything off the gallery of a user from FurAffinity off that one onion site that archives everything ever posted on FA, now made 100% more idiot proof so long as you know how to use the terminal and give it permissions to the current active user or all users (sudo chmod 777 FAG-D.sh)
Just run it through the terminal and it'll do the rest. 

This only works on Arch Linux, Manjaro, and any other Arch-based Linux distro out there (excluding Artix Linux as it doesn't use SystemD)
