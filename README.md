# FurAffinity-gallery-downloader
A small script to download everything off the gallery of a user from FurAffinity off that one onion site that archives everything ever posted on FA, now made 100% more idiot proof if you're an Arch User like me.
Just run it through the Arch Linux terminal and it'll do the rest. 

This only works on Arch Linux, Manjaro, and any other Arch-based Linux distro out there (excluding Artix Linux as it doesn't use SystemD)
