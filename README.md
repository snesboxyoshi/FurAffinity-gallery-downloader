# FurAffinity-gallery-downloader
A small script to download everything off the gallery of a user from FurAffinity off that one onion site that archives everything ever posted on FA, now made 100% more idiot proof if you're an Arch User like me.
Just run it through the Arch Linux terminal and it'll do the rest. ARCH LINUX ONLY.
